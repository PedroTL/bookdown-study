## Multivariate Analysis

We have many variables with corresponding data, so we want to make sense of them.

#### 1.1 Introduction to Matrix Algebra

What is Matrix?

-   A way to group number or symbols together, where you have rows and columns
-   A matrix is a rectangular array of elements arranged in rows and columns

The dimension of a matrix is giving by:

-   Rows
-   Columns
-   Rows X Columns $r x c$

Here we have a 3x2 Matrix

```{r}
matrix(data = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), 
       nrow = 3, 
       ncol = 2)
```

Rather than using numbers, we can represent parts of a matrix (and the matrix itself) by symbols.

Example:

Where $a_{ij}$ is the row $i$ and column $j$ element of $A$. $a_{11}$ is often called $(1,1)$ element of $A$, $a_{12}$ is the $(1,2)$ element of \$A.

When writing in hand we cannot bold the letter $A$ so we use the underlined $\underline{A}$

Square matrix is $r x c$ where $r = c$

**Vector** - A $r x 1$ is a *column vector*

**Vector** - A $1 x r$ is a *row vector*

Both being a special case matrix.

```{r}
matrix(data = c(1, 2, 3),
       ncol = 1,
       nrow = 3)
```

**Transpose** - Is when we interchange the rows and columns of a matrix or vector

Example:

![](C:\Users\pedro\Documents\GitHub\bookdown-study\introduction-multivariated-analysis-r\images\matrix_2.png)

```{r}
matrix(data = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6),
       nrow = 2,
       ncol = 3)
```

```{r}
matrix(data = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6),
       nrow = 3,
       ncol = 2)
```

$A$ is 2x3 and $A'$ is a 3x2. The $'$ symbol indicates a transpose, and it is said as the word *prime*. Thus, the transpose of $A$ is *A prime*.

##### 1.1.1 Introduction to Matrix Algebra - Matrix addition and subtraction

Adding or subtraction the corresponding elements of matrices *with the same dimension*.

Example

```{r}
MA <- matrix(data = c(1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7), 
             nrow = 2,
             ncol = 3,
             byrow = TRUE)

MB <- matrix(data = c(-1, 10, -1, 5, 5, 8),
             nrow = 2,
             ncol = 3,
             byrow = TRUE)
MA
MB
```

Then $A + B$ is:

```{r}
MA + MB
```

and $A - B$ is:

```{r}
MA - MB
```

`byrow` by default is set to `FALSE`. Thus, the number would be entered into the matrix by columns. Example

```{r}
MX <- matrix(data = c(1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7), 
             nrow = 2,
             ncol = 3,
             byrow = FALSE)
MX
class(MX)
```

A transpose of a matri can be done using the `t()` function.

```{r}
t(MX)
```

##### 1.1.2 Matrix multiplication

**Scalar** - Is a 1x1 matrix

Multiplied a matrix by a scalar

![](C:\Users\pedro\Documents\GitHub\bookdown-study\introduction-multivariated-analysis-r\images\matrix_3.png) When $A$ is equal to:

```{r}
MA <- matrix(data = 1:6, 
             nrow = 2, 
             ncol = 3,
             byrow = TRUE)
```

and $c = 2$, then $2A$ is:

```{r}
MA*2
```

**Multiplying two matrices**

If we want to multiply $A$ for $B$ $A*B$ we first need the number of columns of $A$ to be the same as the number of rows from $B$. So $A_{rows} = B_{columns}$.

Example

$A$ is a 2x3 and $B$ is a $3x10$, then you can multiply this matrices. However, if $B$ is a 4x10 instead, these matrices cannot be multiplied.

The resulting dimentions of $C = A*B$:

-   The number of rows of $A$ is the number of rows of $C$.
-   The number of columns of $B$ is the number of rows of $C$

![](C:\Users\pedro\Documents\GitHub\bookdown-study\introduction-multivariated-analysis-r\images\matrix_4.png)

```{r}
MA <- matrix(data = 1:6,
             nrow = 2,
             ncol = 3,
             byrow = TRUE)

MB <- matrix(data = c(3, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1),
             ncol = 2,
             nrow = 3,
             byrow = TRUE)

MA
MB
```

```{r}
MC_1 = MA%*%MB
MC_1
```

The *cross product* of the rows of $A$ and the columns of $B$ are taken to form $C$.

Being $MA*MC \neq MB*MC$

```{r}
MC_2 = MB%*%MA
MC_2
```

The notation `%*%` is used to multiplied matrices and vectors, where `*` stays to perform elementwise multiplications, the $(i,j)$ elements of each matrix are multiplied together.

Multiplying vectors with other vector or matrices in R can be confusing because no row or column dimensions are given for a vector object. Example

```{r}
MX <- c(1, 2, 3)
```

```{r}
MX%*%MX
MA%*%MX
```

How does R know that we want $MX'MX$ instead of $MXMX'$ when we have not told R that $MX$ is a 3x1?

Similarly, how does R know that $MA*MX$ is a 2x1. From `R Help` `%*%`

*Multiplies two matrices, if they are conformable. If one argument is a vector, it will be promoted to either a row or column matrix to make the two arguments conformable. If both are vectors it will return the inner product.*

An inner product produces a scalar value. If you wanted a $MXMX'$, one can use the outer product `%o%`

```{r}
MX%o%MX
```

- `cbind()` combines items by *columns*
- `rbind()` combines items by *rows*
